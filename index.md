### 1. Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

> This machine learning project aims to predict the future price of the stock market based on the previous year’s data.

*   Predictive Analysis: Leveraging various AI techniques for different data processes such as data mining, data exploration, etc. to ‘predict’ the behaviour of possible outcomes.
*   Regression Analysis: Regressive analysis is a kind of predictive technique based on the interaction between a dependent (target) and independent variable/s (predictor).
*   Action Analysis: In this method, all the actions carried out by the two techniques mentioned above are analyzed after which the outcome is fed into the machine learning memory.
*   Statistical Modeling: It involves building a mathematical description of a real-world process and elaborating the uncertainties, if any, within that process.  


### 2. Enhance Healthcare

*   Diagnostic care systems that can automatically scan images, X-rays, etc., and provide an accurate diagnosis of possible diseases.
*   Preventative care applications that can predict the possibilities of epidemics such as flu, malaria, etc., both at the national and community level.
